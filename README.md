# ResNet-34 Transfer Learning for Image Classification

This repository contains the implementation of transfer learning using the ResNet-34 architecture for image classification. Transfer learning is a powerful technique that leverages pre-trained models to achieve better performance on specific tasks. In this project, we fine-tune the ResNet-34 model on a custom image classification dataset to improve its accuracy.

## Introduction

Image classification is a common task in computer vision, and deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in this domain. Transfer learning allows us to utilize pre-trained models, which have been trained on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, and adapt them to new tasks with relatively small datasets.

The ResNet-34 architecture is a deep convolutional neural network that has shown excellent performance in image classification tasks. By fine-tuning the ResNet-34 model on a new dataset, we can take advantage of its learned features while customizing it for our specific classification problem.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is not included in this repository. You will need to prepare your own custom image dataset for classification. Ensure that the dataset is organized into separate directories for each class, and adjust the code accordingly to load and preprocess the data.

## Model Architecture

The ResNet-34 architecture consists of 34 layers, including convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, activation functions, and a fully connected layer for classification. It uses residual connections to address the vanishing gradient problem and enables the training of deeper networks.

In this project, we load the pre-trained ResNet-34 model and replace the fully connected layer with a new one that matches the number of classes in our custom dataset. We freeze the pre-trained layers to retain their learned features and only train the last fully connected layer and possibly a few additional layers for fine-tuning.

## Installation

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aatmprakash/ResNet-34-Transfer-Learning-for-Image-Classification.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Before running the code, make sure you have installed the required dependencies and prepared your dataset accordingly.

To train the ResNet-34 model, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

The model will begin training using the specified dataset and hyperparameters. The trained model checkpoints will be saved for future use.

To evaluate the trained model on the test dataset, run the following command:

```
python evaluate.py --model saved_models/model.pth
```

Replace `model.pth` with the appropriate saved model checkpoint file.

## Results

The evaluation script will provide metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the trained ResNet-34 model on the test dataset. These metrics measure the model's ability to correctly classify the images into different classes.

The results obtained from the evaluation can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the transfer learning approach with ResNet-34 for image classification tasks and compare its performance with other models or approaches.
